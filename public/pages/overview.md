# 📖 Overview

## About

As a versatile software engineer, I have amassed experience in developing intricate applications across both web and mobile platforms. I started my journey as an iOS App Developer, where I helped maintain and improve a real-time chat app. This experience amplified my understanding of intuitive interface design, secure data storage, and user authentication.

Moving into the role of a Software Engineer, I further honed my skills in dynamic, responsive web applications, creating innovative features and ensuring seamless user experiences with advanced technologies such as React.js, Redux, and JavaScript. I've excelled in Agile environments, consistently delivering high-quality software development solutions.

On the academic front, I have a dual master's degree in Computer Science and Computer Software Engineering, where I studied a range of topics from Applied Machine Learning to Cloud Computing. My broad technical expertise spans across diverse tech stacks, including Java, Python, Swift, various AWS services, and several database systems.

Beyond my work experience and academic background, I have engaged in meaningful projects that emphasize my proficiency in data cleaning, full-stack development, and database integration. These initiatives highlight my capability to improve data quality, create robust online marketplaces, and develop insightful dashboards for specific use cases.

I continuously strive to adapt and learn, keeping abreast with the latest trends and advancements in the tech industry, driven by a passion for creating practical and user-centric solutions.
