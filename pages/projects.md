## `Jun 2023 - Jul 2023` [Case Study in Data Cleaning and Provenance](https://github.com/willychang21/Case-Study-in-Data-Cleaning-and-Provenance) ðŸ”—
The group project aimed to perform a comprehensive data cleaning study by leveraging various tools and techniques covered during the course. The primary tools utilized included **OpenRefine**, **SQLite**, and **YesWorkflow**.

The project's focus was on improving data quality, particularly when dealing with aggregate data calculations between different data entities, aligned with the **U1 Main Use Case**. Both the OpenRefine and SQLite processes played critical roles in successfully accomplishing the project's goals.

Although the team faced some challenges with SQLite conventions, like frequent use of **UPSERT** operations, these conventions were necessary to achieve high-speed execution of SQLite-based operations. While other SQL platforms with UPDATE operations and JOIN conditions might have offered more concise expressions, the chosen UPSERT approach allowed the team to implement a rapid and efficient SQL-based cleanup process.

Overall, the project showcases the team's proficiency in using a variety of data cleaning tools and demonstrates their ability to enhance data quality in support of a significant use case.
